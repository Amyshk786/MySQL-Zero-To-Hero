RANK & DENSE RANK - 
===================



-> We should be using the order by clause

-> We can also use the partition by - But its optional

-> The row number starts from 1 for Every Partition


Important Note - 
================

1) If There Are No Duplicates Then "Row Number", "RANK" & "DENSE RANK" Lead to Similar Results.

2) Only The Difference Comes When There Are Duplicates

3) RANK - For Duplicates Same Rank is Assigned  and For The Next Entry It Skips the Ranks.

4) DENSE RANK - For Duplicates Same Rank is Assigned  and For The Next Entry It Does Not Skips the Ranks.
