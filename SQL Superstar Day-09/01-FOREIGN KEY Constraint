Day-9 Master Foreign Keys in One Detailed Video
================================================


- Foreign Key Constraint is Used to Enforce a Link Between 2 Tables

- Also A Foreign Key Constraint Can be Used to Enforce Referential Data Integrity Between 2 Tables

- We Can Relate 2 Tables by Using the Foreign Key Constraint

- Primary Key in the 1st Table will be the Foreign Key in the 2nd Table [As Shown Below]



->  We have Created Customers Table

Table N0-1

CREATE TABLE customers (
customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
first_name VARCHAR(50),
last_name VARCHAR(50)
);




-> We have Created Orders Table

Table No-2

CREATE TABLE orders (
order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
order_date DATE,
customer_id INT,
FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (customer_id)
);




-> Inserting Data

- Customer No1

INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, first_name, last_name)
VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe');

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id)
VALUES (1, '2023-07-01', 1);




- Customer No2

As we have No Data for Customer Number 2 in the "Customers" Table so It will Throw an Error [Cannot Add or Update a Child Row A Foreign Key Constraint Fails]

INSERT INTO orders (order_id, order_date, customer_id)
VALUES (2, '2023-07-02', 2);
