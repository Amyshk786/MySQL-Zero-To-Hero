Difference Between DELETE & TRUNCATE
======================================


# Both DELETE & TRUNCATR is used to Delete the Data


1) DELETE - This is a DML Operation

Using DELETE we can Delete Selected Data OR We Can Delete All the Data

DELETE FROM customers WHERE customer_id = 7;

DELETE FROM customers;






2) TRUNCATE - This is a DDL Operation [It Drop's the Table & Re-Create It] [Get Rid of Entire Data in the Table]


- In TRUNCATE We Do Not Have an Option to Delete Selected Data [You can Only Delete All the Data]

- It Drops the Table and Recreate It

- To Achieve High Performance Truncate Table More Effective than Using Delete Table Command

- As Truncate is a DDL Operation so it does a Implicit Commit and It Can't be ROLLED back
