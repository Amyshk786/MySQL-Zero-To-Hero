WHERE vs HAVING Clause in SQL
=============================


-> WHERE is used before group by and it can do filtering on individual records

-> HAVING is used after group by and it can do filtering on aggregated records.



Note - We can use where and having in the same query also. Like Below 

[SELECT location,count(*) AS total FROM students WHERE years_of_exp > 10 GROUP BY location HAVING total > 1;]


Important Note - WHERE is more performant than HAVING.
