1. Primary Key - Agar humri org e 2 Employee Same name Age and Salary k h toh unko Differentiate krne k liye Primary key ka Conecpt h.

-> It Helps us to Uniquely Identify Each Record in the table. For a Primary Key NULL Value is not Allowed & Duplicate values are also Not Allowed.

-> We can have Only One Primary Key & The PRIMARY KEY Cannot Hold Any NULL Value.

-> We Should Use the PRIMARY KEY when we have to Uniquely Identify Each Record.

-> Can be Used in Customer ID, Employee ID, Roll Number Etc..





2. Auto Increment Keys - Means Agar Hum Isme ID nhi enter krege toh wo Automatically Aage ka number lete jyega 





3. Unique Key - UNIQUE KEY Also Cannot Hold Any Duplicates, But Unique Key can Hold NULL.

For Eg- In MYSQL A Unique Key can Hold Any Number of NULL Values, But in Some of the Other Databases Unique Key Can Hold Only One NULL Value.

-> Purpose of Unique is to Make Sure that we do not get Duplicate Values.  

-> We Can have Unique Keys on More than One Column.

-> We can Have Only One Primary Key But Multiple Unique Keys in a Table.

-> Employee ID Can be a Primary Key & Employee Email Can be a Unique Key. 





4. Primary Key VS Unique Key 



The primary differences between a primary key and a unique key in a relational database are as follows:

1. *Uniqueness*:
   - *Primary Key*: Ensures that all the values in a column are unique and not null.
   - *Unique Key*: Ensures that all the values in a column are unique but can contain a single null value.

2. *Null Values*:
   - *Primary Key*: Cannot contain null values.
   - *Unique Key*: Can contain a single null value (in most database systems).

3. *Number of Keys*:
   - *Primary Key*: There can only be one primary key per table.
   - *Unique Key*: There can be multiple unique keys per table.

4. *Purpose*:
   - *Primary Key*: Primarily used to uniquely identify each record in a table.
   - *Unique Key*: Ensures data integrity by preventing duplicate values in a column or combination of columns.


Note - Both primary and unique keys play important roles in maintaining the integrity and efficiency of a database.
