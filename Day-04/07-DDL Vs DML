DDL Vs DML


Data Defination Language - DDL Statements are the ones which Change the Table Structure, They Do Not Manuplate the Data. DDL Commands are [CREATE, ALTER, DROP & TRUNCATE]

TRUNCATE - It Internally Drops the Table and Recreates it.


Data Manuplation Language - DML Statements where we Deal with the Data Directly.  DML Commands are [INSERT, UPDATE & DELETE]
