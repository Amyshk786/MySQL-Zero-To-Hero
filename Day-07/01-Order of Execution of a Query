Session 7 -


Problem Statement - In the Previous Lecture we were not able to execute the below Query

SELECT DISTINCT source_of_joining FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date desc;



Example 1 

Order of Execution of a Query

For eg we fire this query 

SELECT source_of_joining FROM student;

+-------------------+
| source_of_joining |
+-------------------+
| linkedin          |
| google            |
| quora             |
| linkedin          |
| friend            |
| youtube           |
| youtube           |
| google            |
+-------------------+

Order Of Execution - 

First "FROM" will get Executed it will Load the Table first (Loading the Table)

SELECT We are Projecting source_of_joining from the student table (Projecting source_of_joining)








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Example 2

But when we Add ORDER BY in the Query the Order Of Execution will be 

SELECT source_of_joining, enrollment_date FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date;

+-------------------+---------------------+
| source_of_joining | enrollment_date     |
+-------------------+---------------------+
| linkedin          | 2024-07-21 12:24:48 |
| google            | 2024-07-21 12:24:48 |
| quora             | 2024-07-21 12:24:49 |
| linkedin          | 2024-07-21 12:25:57 |
| friend            | 2024-07-21 12:27:29 |
| youtube           | 2024-07-21 12:27:29 |
| youtube           | 2024-07-21 12:27:29 |
| google            | 2024-07-21 12:27:29 |
+-------------------+---------------------+


First "FROM" will get Executed it will Load the Table first (Loading the Table)

SELECT We are Projecting source_of_joining from the student table (Projecting source_of_joining, enrollment_date)

ORDER BY (On the basis of "enrollment_date" it will do ORDER BY)

SELECT source_of_joining, enrollment_date FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date;
