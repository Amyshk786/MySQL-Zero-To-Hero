Example 3 - If we use the below Query


SELECT source_of_joining FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date;

+-------------------+
| source_of_joining |
+-------------------+
| linkedin          |
| google            |
| quora             |
| linkedin          |
| friend            |
| youtube           |
| youtube           |
| google            |
+-------------------+


First "FROM" will get Executed it will Load the Table first (Loading the Table)

SELECT We are Projecting source_of_joining, enrollment_date from the student table (Projecting source_of_joining, enrollment_date as system knows we have added ORDER BY on enrollment_date so it will use that but jab Result show karega tab enrollment_date nhi show hogi)  [Refer Example 2 & Example 3]

ORDER BY (On the basis of "enrollment_date" it will do ORDER BY)

SELECT source_of_joining, FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date;








-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Example 4 - 

SELECT DISTINCT source_of_joining FROM student ORDER BY enrollment_date desc;



First "FROM" will get Executed it will Load the Table first (Loading the Table)

SELECT We are Projecting source_of_joining, enrollment_date from the student table (Projecting source_of_joining, enrollment_date)

DISTINCT [Note 1 & Note 2 me jo query fire kiye h usme Note 1 me 5 Results show kr raha h & Note 2 me 7 Results Is wajah se ye Query me error aa rha h q ki system Wrong result dene k bajaye Error de rha h]
