-- Basics of MySQL


1. To Create a  Database use the below query
 create database school;


2. To check if the Database is created or not use below query
show databases;


3. If we want to Go into a Particular Database use below query
USE school;


4. If we want to check in which Database we are in so we can use below query
select database();


5. To create a Table in a Database
CREATE TABLE student
(
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT ,
class INT
);


6. If we want to show the Table which we have created in our Database
show tables;


7. If we want to see the Structure or Schema of the Table
describe student;
OR
desc student;


8. If we want to drop the table
drop table student;


9. If we want to Drop Database
drop database school;

[We were in the school DB, If we drop school DB & if we now check in which DB we are in it will show as NULL. Because uper humne school DB ko drop kr diya h] 

[Agar hum abhi koi table create krege toh error aayega stating "NO DATABASE SELECTED" q ki humne school DB ko Drop kr diye]


10. Humne fir se school DB create kiye
create database school;


11. Abhi hum school DB ko use nhi krege and ye query run krege toh q ki humne table k phle school. dale toh wo school DB k andar hi student name ka table create krega 
CREATE TABLE school.student
(
name VARCHAR(50),
age INT ,
class INT
);


12. Agar hum check krege k hum abhi konse DB me h toh wo humein NULL kr k hi show krega q ki humne koi DB use nhi kiye
select database();
